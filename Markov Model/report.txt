1. Hours to complete the project: 10 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Markov Model Data Type): Understanding the project was hard for
me at first. I faced a lot of problem while doing replace_unknown. It 
individually work for the first problem but later didn't work for problem 2
and 3. I had to change the inner for loop in the "replace_unknown" function.
And sometimes I didn't call use self. which also gave me an error. My friend
Joyce helped me to fix these issues.

   Problem 2 (Random Text Generator): This problem was straightforward, I
didn't really face any problem. The checklist was very helpful.

   Problem 3 (Noisy Message Decoder): The coding for this problem was
straighforward too. Initially I got error for the replace_unknown, so I had to
fix that.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Tour Data Type): Understanding the problem was easier comparing
with other prokects. I just had a hard time while doing the last two function.
But after going to the SI, I could easily complete the whole project.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

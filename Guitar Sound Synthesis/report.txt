1. Hours to complete the project: 3 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Ring Buffer): Understanding the concept of ring buffer and each
 element inside the buffer was difficult at first. Then our supplimental
instructor explained everything in detail about each element. That helped to
understand the part before enqueue. To understand the enqueue and dequeue we
drew everything every possible steps and then came up with the solution.

   Problem 2 (Guitar String): The 'create' and 'create_from_samples' wasn't in
order, so it was confusing to understand. In the 'tic' function I did 
buffer.peek at first, and forgot to dequeue, later my S.I helped me to figure
that out

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
